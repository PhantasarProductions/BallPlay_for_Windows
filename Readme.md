# BallPlay for Windows

This game served as the pre-investigation experiments that would lead to The Fairy Tale... The original game, that is.
I've been using Blitz Basic for quite awhile before moving on to BlitzMax. 

The code SHOULD compile in Blitz3D, I've never tried to get this running in BlitzPlus. 
Please note that I haven't touched this code in ages, so it's really hard for me to fully see if this code will fully work the way it's intended, and although I have a Blitz3D compiler at the ready, don't expect me to fix any bugs any more.
It's simply too long ago. 

I will try to get a working copy on the run sometime soon, as I've already seen that this code doesn't follow the "holy" conventions of using the home directory like modern applications should.


# Mac and Linux users

As far as I know BlitzBasic programs are compatible with WINE, so that means you should be able to run the game using WINE, however there are no guarantees.



# License

The statement inside the code states you may not modify the code, well I myself don't care about that anymore.
If you really want to make modifications to it, you can spread those under the terms of the GPL version 3.
